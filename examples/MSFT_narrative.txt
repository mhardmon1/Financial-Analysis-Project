1. Technical Indicators:
   - 3-Year Return: MSFT has outperformed the S&P 500 with a 3-year return of 70.5% compared to the index's 64.4%. This indicates strong relative performance.
   - Linear Model R²: The linear model's R² of 0.647 suggests that the model explains 64.7% of the stock's price movement, indicating a moderate correlation.
   - LSTM Model R²: The LSTM model's R² of 0.968 implies a much stronger correlation, with the model explaining 96.8% of the stock's price movement. This suggests that the LSTM model captures more complex patterns and trends in the data.

2. Differences between 60-day Linear and LSTM Forecasts:
   - Accuracy: The LSTM model's higher R² value indicates that it provides more accurate forecasts than the linear model. This is likely due to LSTM's ability to learn from sequential data and capture non-linear relationships.
   - Complexity: The LSTM model, being a type of neural network, can handle complex patterns and trends in the data, making it more suitable for stock price forecasting than the simpler linear model.

3. Actionable Insight:
   - Given the superior performance of the LSTM model, it suggests that MSFT's stock price movement is influenced by complex, non-linear factors. Therefore, for investment decisions, consider using advanced models like LSTM for more accurate forecasts.
   - Despite the strong 3-year return, the moderate linear model R² indicates that there are other factors influencing MSFT's stock price that the linear model cannot capture. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis considering both linear and non-linear factors is recommended.
