1. Technical Indicators:
   - 3-Year Return: AAPL has delivered a 3-year return of 26.0%, which is lower than the S&P 500's 64.4%. This suggests that AAPL's performance has been relatively weaker compared to the broader market.
   - Linear Model R²: The linear model's R² value of 0.477 indicates that the model explains 47.7% of the variation in AAPL's stock price. This is a moderate correlation, suggesting that other factors not included in the model also influence AAPL's stock price.
   - LSTM Model R²: The LSTM model's R² value of 0.948 is significantly higher than the linear model, indicating that the LSTM model explains 94.8% of the variation in AAPL's stock price. This suggests that the LSTM model captures more complex patterns and trends in the data.

2. Differences between 60-day Linear and LSTM Forecasts:
   - Accuracy: The LSTM model's higher R² value suggests that it provides more accurate forecasts than the linear model. This is likely due to LSTM's ability to capture non-linear relationships and trends in the data, which linear models may miss.
   - Complexity: The LSTM model, being a type of neural network, is more complex than a linear model. It can learn and make predictions based on a larger number of features and their interactions, making it more suitable for complex time series data like stock prices.

3. Actionable Insight:
   - Given the significant difference in performance between the linear and LSTM models, it suggests that LSTM could provide more reliable forecasts for AAPL's stock price. Therefore, investors might want to consider using LSTM-based models for their forecasting needs.
